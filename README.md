# Untitled-Game

This is a work-in-progress minecraft-style game I'm developing in my spare time.  The core of the engine has been adapted from [Hazel2D] (https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel).

## Installation
This is a Windows-only project for the time being. Visual Studio (2017, 2019, or 2022) is recommended for development.

#### Download
To download this repository, simply use the command git clone --recursive https://github.com/liamw1/Untitled-Game

#### Configure Dependencies
To configure the necessary dependencies, simply run Setup.bat, which can be found in the `scripts` folder.  The script may need to be run multiple times.  After everything has finished, run one of the 'GenProjects' scripts to generate Visual Studio solution files.
