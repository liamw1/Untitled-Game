Engine formatting guidelines:
  Classes should be PascalCase.
  Static members should also be PascalCase.
  Private/protected static variables should be preceeded with an "s_", i.e. s_StaticVariable.
    - This also applies to globally inaccessible static variables in .cpp files
  Public non-static members should be camelCase.
  Private/protected non-static variables should be preceeded with an "m_", i.e m_Variable.
  All public members should appear first, followed by protected members, followed by private members.
  Enums should be written in PascalCase.
  Macros should be written in UPPER_CASE.
  
  Identation should consist of two spaces.
  Curly brackets should always be on their own lines, except in the cases of empty constructors or simple inline functions.

  Use angular brackets when including libraries, i.e. #include <string>. Quotes for everything else, i.e. #include "MyFile.h".
